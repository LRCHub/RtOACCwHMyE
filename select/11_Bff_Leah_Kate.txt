You drag me down (Whoa)
Yeah, you drag me down (Whoa)

Pretty face, always say you're a good girl
So contagious, I wanna play in your bad world
'Cause you always look so damn perfect
Didn't know that your touch could burn me
Can't explain why this cravin' is so real, so real

Need another fix
Every time I think it's over
Oh, you make it so toxic
I just want to get in closer

You drag me down and nobody knows
I wanted out, but I can't let go
Just a little more before I get away
Won't hurt me if I take another day
You drag me down and I can't let go

Wake me up 'cause I'm stuck in a nightmare
I never wanted to be lost, goin' nowhere, nowhere
But it always felt so damn perfect
Didn't know that it wouldn't be worth it
One touch, start to rush and I go there, go there

Need another fix
Every time I think it's over
Oh, you make it so toxic
I just want to get in closer

You drag me down and nobody knows
I wanted out, but I can't let go
Just a little more before I get away
Won't hurt me if I take another day
You drag me down and I can't let go

You drag me down
Yeah, you drag me down

You drag me down and nobody knows
I wanted out, but I can't let go
Just a little more before I get away (Get away)
Won't hurt me if I take another day (Another day)
You drag me down and I can't let go, no

(Yeah, yeah)
You drag me down and I can't let go
(Yeah, yeah)
You drag me down and I can't let go
(Yeah, yeah)
You drag me down, I can't let go
(Yeah, yeah)
You drag me down and I can't let go
